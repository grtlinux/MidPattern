say / tell
say는 절대 사람을 목적어로 취하지 않는다.
say something(무엇이라고 (말)하다)이라고 하거나 say something to somebody(누구에게 무엇이라고 (말)하다)와 같이만 쓴다.
say는 흔히 누구의 말을 정확히 그대로 옮길 때 쓴다:‘Sit down’, she said.
"앉으세요." 그녀가 말했다.
Anne said, ‘I’m tired.’
앤이 "난 피곤해"라고 말했다.
Anne said (that) she was tired.
앤은 피곤하다고 했다.
What did he say to you?
그가 너한테 뭐라고 그랬니?
‘say about’이라고는 하지 않는다.
say something about과 같이 써야 옳다:I want to say something / a few words / a little about my family.
제가 저의 가족에 대해 말씀을 좀 드리고자 합니다.
말을 듣는 상대방을 언급하지 않을 때에는 say를 절과 함께 쓸 수도 있다.She didn’t say what she intended to do.
그녀는 자기가 뭘 하려는 것인지 말하지 않았다.
tell은 보통 사람을 목적어로 취해서, 흔히 목적어를 두 개 취한다:Have you told him the news yet?
그에게 그 소식을 이미 전했니?
tell은 보통 ‘that’ 절과 함께 쓰인다:Anne told me (that) she was tired.
앤이 피곤하다고 나에게 말했다.
tell은 보통 누구에게 어떤 사실이나 정보를 알려 줄 때 쓰여 흔히 what, where 등과 함께 쓰인다:Can you tell me when the movie starts?
그 영화가 언제 시작하는지 저에게 알려 줄 수 있으세요?
(Can you give me some information about the school?
그 학교에 대해 제게 정보를 좀 알려 주실 수 있으세요?
과 비교해 보라. )
tell은 또 누군가에게 지시를 할 때도 쓴다:The doctor told me to stay in bed.
의사가 내게 누워 있으라고 했다.
The doctor told me (that) I had to stay in bed.
의사가 내게 누워 있어야 한다고 했다.
또는 The doctor said (that) I had to stay in bed.
의사가 내게 누워 있어야 한다고 했다.
그러나 다음과 같이 말하진 않는다:The doctor said me to stay in bed.


talk & speak

이 단어들은 모두 뉴스, 정보, 생각, 감정을, 특히 대화를 통해, 다른 사람(들)과 공유함을 나타낸다.
talk 말하다, 이야기하다, 수다를 떨다:We talked on the phone for over an hour.

"수잔 좀 바꿔 주시겠어요?"
‘Speaking.’

talk or speak?◇speak는 talk보다 격식성 정도가 더 높은 대화를 시사할 수 있다.
◇speak는 특정한 목표를 달성하기 위해 또는 누구에게 무엇을 하라고 하기 위해 말을 하는 것을 나타낸다.
◇talk는 친교 행위로나 남의 조언을 구하기 위해 말을 하는 것을 나타낸다:
Have you talked to your parents about the problems you’re having?
네가 가진 문제들에 대해 부모님께 말씀을 드려 보았니?
